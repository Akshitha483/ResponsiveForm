                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals.
                    Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on
                    the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

                <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, 
                without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, 
                each location being a data center.
